<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello!</h1>

<p align="center">My name is Oscar, and I'm a student learning to code. Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm thrilled that you're here to learn more about me and my programming journey.</p>

<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

<p align="center">I'm currently studying software engineering at <a href="http://42roma.it"> <img align="center" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Roma-ffffff?style=for-the-badge&logo=42&logoColor=black" alt="42"></a> a new innovative educational program based on the 42 model. Before this, I had a diverse range of experiences, from owning a restaurant to working in retail and customer service. These experiences taught me a lot about teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability.</p>

<p align="center">Even though I'm just getting started with coding, I've always been interested in technology and building things. I love learning how systems work and discovering ways to leverage technology to improve people's lives. My goal is to develop innovative solutions to important problems.</p>

<p align="center">Outside of programming, I enjoy activities like cycling, hiking, traveling, and photography. Experiencing new cultures and connecting with people from all walks of life inspires me. I try to nurture an optimistic growth mindset in all areas of life. There's always an opportunity to expand your mind and improve your skills!</p>

<h1 align="center">Skills and Tools</h1>


<p align ="center">I'm still learning, but here are some of the skills and tools I'm familiar with:</p>

<h1 align="center"> What I'm Learning</h1>

<p align="center">Right now, I'm focused on the cursus of 42 Network. We are diving deep into various topics such as C language, BASH, data structures, algorithms, web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), networking (TCP/IP, network protocols), system administration (Linux-based operating systems), and software engineering methodologies. My goal is to learn system and kernel development, with the hope of contributing to open-source projects like Linux distributions or developing open and free operating systems for mobile devices. In the future, I'm also eager to explore Rust.</p>

<p align="center">I'd love to connect with other developers and mentors in these areas. There's so much to learn, and guidance from more experienced programmers would be invaluable.</p>
